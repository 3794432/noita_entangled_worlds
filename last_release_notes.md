## Installation


Download and unpack `noita-proxy-win.zip` or `noita-proxy-linux.zip`, depending on your OS. After that, launch the proxy.


Proxy is able to download and install the mod automatically. There is no need to download the mod (`quant.ew.zip`) manually.


You'll be prompted for a path to `noita.exe` when launching the proxy for the first time.
It should be detected automatically as long as you use steam version of the game and steam is launched.
        

## Updating


There is a button in bottom-left corner on noita-proxy's main screen that allows to auto-update to a new version when one is available
