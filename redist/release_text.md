# Installation
Download Noita Proxy (noita-proxy-win.zip) and unpack it somewhere.

Download the mod in quant.ew.zip

Go to Noita mod folder (can be done from in-game Mods menu item) and unpack the archive here. There should now be quant.ew folder inside the mods folder. Enable the mod in noita.

# Running

Note: order is important.

Start the game, start the proxy.

Now you'll probably want to use Steam for connection. Use "Create lobby" and "Connect to lobby in clipboard" buttons to do so.
Another option is to connect by ip. Proxy creates a socket on port 5123, UDP protocol.

Press new game button in Noita now.
