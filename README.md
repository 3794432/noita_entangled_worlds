## Noita Entangled Worlds - Play Noita not alone

Noita Entangled Worlds is an experimental mod for Noita that aims to make a true coop multiplayer possible.

What is synced as of now:
 - Players, their positions, health, perks and inventories
 - Wand usage
 - Item usage
 - Items in world (One player can throw a wand/potion/spell/item, another can pick it up)
 - Enemies and their attacks
 - Pixels of the grid world (this one is far from perfect, however)
 - Fungal shifts
 - Polymorphing

There is a video guide/showcase of the mod by Gudyni (in russian): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqSKcDW-epg
There is also a gameplay video by FuryForged: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QihnJKXMHw

## Installation (provided by @stefnotch)

Go to [releases](https://github.com/IntQuant/noita_entangled_worlds/releases) and download the latest `noita-proxy-win.zip` or `noita-proxy-linux.zip`, depending on your OS.

Unpack it, and launch the proxy. Proxy is able to download and install the mod automatically.

Then, start Noita, and enable the mod.
1. In the "Mods" menu, enable unsafe mods.
2. Then, enable the "Quant's Entangled Worlds" mod.

Now you're ready to start a server and have fun!

## Connect using Steam

In the Proxy window, click on "Create Lobby". Then, "Save lobby ID to clipboard". Send that ID to your friends, who can then *copy* it and press "Connect to lobby in clipboard".

After that, just start a new Noita game on everyone's PCs, and you should be in multiplayer mode :)
