# Noita Entangled Worlds

Noita Entangled Worlds is an experimental mod for Noita that aims to make a true coop multiplayer possible.

What is synced as of now:
 - Players, their positions, health, perks and inventories
 - Wand usage
 - Item usage
 - Items in world (One player can throw a wand/potion/spell/item, another can pick it up)
 - Enemies and their attacks
 - Pixels of the grid world (this one is far from perfect, however)

There is a video guide/showcase of the mod by Gudyni (in russian): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqSKcDW-epg
